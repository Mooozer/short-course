### Model-based Inference in Ecology and Epidemiology
#### [Course Notes](http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/)

These are notes for a short course given by Aaron King as part of the Summer College of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics.
They draw in large part on the notes for the [SISMID course](http://kingaa.github.io/sbied).
From the [main page](http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/), links lead to pages on a number of specific topics, culminating in four case studies that exemplify the methods and raise key issues.
For each such page, there is a corresponding **R** script, which contains the codes needed to recapitulate the calculations.
This script is a starting point for students to follow, explore, and modify the analysis according to their own curiosity and interest.
